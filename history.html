            <h1>Welcome to College Of Commerce, Arts and Science</h1>

            <p id="para1">College of Commerce, Arts & science, Patna, established in 1949, recognized under Sections 2 (f) and 12 (B) of the UGC Act 1956 is a premier constituent College of Patliputra University. College was established by great visionary Late Pt. Indu Shekhar Jha on the advice of Dr. Rajendra Prasad with a pious motive to make quality education accessible for aspiring youths without any discrimination based on socio-cultural-economic grounds. The vision of its great founder Pt. Indushekhar Jha was to make the commerce education accessible to the underprivileged and subaltern students of Bihar, which was rarely available. This revered institution started its journey from a small campus where P. N. Anglo School is located now to its present campus. Flowing in the incessant flow of imparting knowledge and being exposed to the warmth of time, this institution went on incorporating many streams in itself and today in this college education is imparted in the faculties of Sciences, Social Sciences, Commerce, Humanities and Law up to postgraduate levels.It is one of the oldest academic institutions located in the heart of the capital of Bihar, Patna. The College is situated in the exclusive neighbourhood of Rajendra Nagar Railway Terminal and inhabits a 5.89-acre plot campus. The lush green landscape invites an aesthetic charmer and enhances the College atmosphere to an educational eden.

 Initially, it was a constituent unit of Magadh University in the name of College of Commerce and was renamed as College of Commerce, Arts & Science in 2016. Later, it became a constituent unit of the Patliputra University, Patna when this university was formed by the Bihar Government on 18 July 2018 after being bifurcated from Magadh University, Bodh Gaya. The College was re-accredited by NAAC as Grade 'A' in its second cycle of accreditation with a CGPA of 3.10 on a four-point scale. After the journey of more than seven decades this institution has achieved its mission and vision to a greater extent for which it was established and it is a matter of great satisfaction that today this institution is acclaimed throughout the state of Bihar for its high academic standards. The College has consistently demonstrated outstanding performance in academics, sports, and Co/extra-curricular activities. It has made significant and unparalleled contributions in terms of producing scholars, bureaucrats, intellectuals, politicians and sportsperson serving in different domains not only in our own country but even at international levels. Vibrant and effective presence of our alumni all over the world at key positions in almost all spheres of life is a testimony of its successful journey.
                </p>

               <p id="para2">
               College of Commerce, Arts and Science is opportune to have a galaxy of faculties who command a rare distinction in academic excellence at least in Bihar and whose accomplishments in academia is appreciated universally. The college dare claims to set new yardsticks in Bihar as far as quality research and teaching is concerned. Despite certain limitations which are beyond the college domain like space constraints, proper playground, etc., our students have excelled in various sports streams at different levels. No matter whether it is NCC or NSS or any other wing, this college has proven its worth.

This college has excellent infrastructure with automated central library linked to world-wide free information flows and databases, well equipped laboratories and congenial and natural campus ambience and classrooms. However, the volume of publication in peer reviewed journals with high impact factor and citation index is moderate but the quality of research is worth citing. College administration is trying its best to catch it soon and increase the volume of research too. Teaching and research in all faculties of Sciences, Social Sciences, Humanities, Commerce and Law are available up to PG level. Ph. D. Programmes are also available in most subjects. The college offers 13 postgraduate, 17 undergraduate, 07 vocational, 03 Add-on (with certificate, diploma and advance diploma) and 04 professional/self-financed courses. The college aspires to commensurate to the national and global standards in teaching as well as in research.
