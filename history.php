                        University. College was established by great visionary Late Pt. Indu Shekhar Jha on the advice

                        youths without any discrimination based on socio-cultural-economic grounds. The vision of its
                        great founder Pt. Indushekhar Jha was to make the commerce education accessible to the

                        institution started its journey from a small campus where P. N. Anglo School is located now to
                        its present campus. Flowing in the incessant flow of imparting knowledge and being exposed to
                        the warmth of time, this institution went on incorporating many streams in itself and today in

                        was renamed as College of Commerce, Arts & Science in 2016. Later, it became a constituent unit
                        of the Patliputra University, Patna when this university was formed by the Bihar Government on
                        18 July 2018 after being bifurcated from Magadh University, Bodh Gaya. The College was
                        re-accredited by NAAC as Grade 'A' in its second cycle of accreditation with a CGPA of 3.10 on a
                        four-point scale. After the journey of more than seven decades this institution has achieved its
                        mission and vision to a greater extent for which it was established and it is a matter of great
                        satisfaction that today this institution is acclaimed throughout the state of Bihar for its high

                        College of Commerce, Arts and Science is opportune to have a galaxy of faculties who command a
